But to calculate these parameters one need different equipment’s and tools that is digital tools. They cost very high and common people want an easy and cheap way to calculate these parameters. So rather than buying these tools one can visit our website and fill in some information and can get an instant value of where they stand in their healthy life.
The basis of this project is to create a platform which can help people to know their fitness level. The software and technique we used to create this forum, HTML, CSS, , JavaScript and Chrome browser for testing purpose. Our overall approach is to create this website to help common people in order to improve their health and fitness. This website  is responsive therefore it can accessible in any wearable devices.
